# 120c vs 80c vs _infinite_c

While most languages prefer to respect the "old" 80c rule, in Java, usually,
we respect the 120c rule.

This happens due to the language verbosity. 80c in Java is really nothing.
120c is enough.

I will not enter in details about that. You could just Google about the 80c/120c
rules.
